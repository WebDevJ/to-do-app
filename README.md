# to-do-app
Crud app, created with Node & Express

The Main functionality of my app is to help people become more organized by allowing them to login from there phones and check, add, update delete there task.

I enjoyed working on this project and will add new functionality in the future. I would love to see a feature were you can as a user send your todo list to another people who are not using the app as a way to spark collaboration and call other new users to action to try the final app.

## What I Used To Make this app:

* Express.js
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* PostgreSQL
* HTML
* CSS
* Heroku

## Install my app locally
1. download this repo
2. do a `npm install --save`




#Issues and Bugs of an app built in 48hrs.

I did ship minimally, but if you download the repository you will see the app is full CRUD and working. Below are the two issues I am still working on but will be apart of the app.

1. Currently the code for the signup feature is not working due to a few bugs but you can view the code on the repo. I ran out of time to debugg. I plan to fix these issues.

2. Lastly, I did deploy to heroku but as of now I am having database issues. The site loads but will not load the data base of todo_list task. I plan to fix this asap.

5. I as a user can then update the status of any task. This button is clearly labeled "Status of Task".
6. I as a user can see clearly when I am in the edit/update view because the heading reads "EDIT" and the name of the task to be updated is present.
7. I as a user can change my mind and cancel a update or the creation of a new task. This button is clearly labeled on the same page as were the edit view or create view is being visited.
